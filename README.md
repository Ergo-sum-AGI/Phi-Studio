This is a dynamic, swirling quantum field of Consciouseness representation that embodies the CQFT theory. Here are the key features:
Mathematical & Conceptual Enhancements:

φ (Phi) Symmetry Throughout - All angular modes, spirals, and rotations use the golden ratio (1.618034) as their fundamental frequency
η (Eta) Anomalous Dimension - Incorporated 0.809017 into the dispersion relation: ω(k) ~ k / (1 + k²/φ²)^η
Quantum Field Dynamics:

Superposition: Multiple interfering wave modes at different scales
Dispersion freeze: Wave propagation slows at the φ-fixed point
Kaleidoscopic patterns: φ-symmetric angular modes (3-5 harmonics)

Firework/Burst Dynamics:

Particles exhibit radial expansion bursts with smooth onset/decay
Spiral trajectories following φ-based Fibonacci expansion
Pulsating point sizes create "explosion" effects

Swirling Motion:

Background rotates in counter-rotating layers
Particles follow curl noise + spiral + radial burst
Color hues cycle based on angular position × φ

Visual Intensity:

Increased particle count (up to 8000)
Stronger bloom (1.8 default)
Bright cores on particles
Dynamic tree with color-shifting emission

Controls to Explore:

Field Speed: Controls time evolution
Particle Spread: Explosion radius
Field Strength: Modulates tree dynamics
Bloom: Increases "glow" intensity

The visualization evokes the quantum field's wave-like propagation, interference patterns, and scale-invariant structure at α = φ!
